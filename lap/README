Golang requires treating a directory as a GO module in order
to fetch dependencies.

Once ldap-tools is installed, a setup script will run
* go mod init lap
* go mod tidy
* go build

The first creates a "module" structure.
The second fetches dependencies.
The third builds an executable.

The custom installer script will put the executable in the bin dir
and then clean up this folder entirely.
